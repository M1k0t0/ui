# Design System

## Overview

LabMate: a low-poly, two-ink language for people and agents working on one project. Every shape is straight edges and flat planes — corners are chamfered (top-left and bottom-right), circles become octagons, and there are no drop shadows or gradient washes. Two inks build the structure; colour appears only when it means something. `AGENTS.md` is the contract; this file is the quick visual summary.

## Colors

- **Ink scale** (structure): Ink `#0A0A0A` · Graphite `#262626` · Slate `#474747` · Steel `#6B6B6B` · Ash `#A3A3A3` · Fog `#D4D4D4` · Mist `#EDEDED` · Paper `#FFFFFF`, plus wells `#F4F4F4` / `#E3E3E3`.
- **Pulse** (lime `#C8F135`): alive — running, current, live. The brand (`--brand`, `variant="brand"`), confirmations, the Switch "on" track.
- **Spark** (coral `#FF6B4A`): a human is needed. Destructive actions, errors, waiting-on-you.
- **Accents are fills, never text on Paper.** Ink text sits on top (`--on-accent`). A card holds at most one Pulse and one Spark element.
- **Status** (`--status-*`, always with a glyph): not started (wells) · ongoing (Pulse) ▶ · paused (amber) ❚❚ · completed (blue) ✓ · failed (Spark) ✕ · halted (Graphite, Paper glyph) ■.
- **Selection** is Ink (Checkbox / Radio / Slider / Progress). Blue is reserved for *completed*.
- **Dark mode** is derived: Ink and Paper swap surface roles; accents and status planes keep their values and Ink text.
- There is one palette — no `data-color-scheme` variants.

## Typography

- **Space Grotesk** for the interface; **JetBrains Mono** for IDs (`LAB-nnn`), metrics, labels and logs. Hosts load the fonts; the library names the families.
- Scale: display 56 · H1 32 (`text-heading`) · H2 20 (`text-title`) · body 15 / lh 1.55 (`text-body`) · control 15 · label 14 · caption 12.
- Mono roles: `text-label-mono` (11px, 500, UPPERCASE, +8%) and `text-data` (12px, +6%, tabular).
- Weights: 600 titles · 500 labels / buttons / chips · 400 body.

## Elevation

Flat, always. Floating menus, popovers, dialogs and panels are separated by a **1.5px Ink border** (and the scrim, for modals) — never by a shadow. The shadow tokens resolve to `none`; `--shadow-hairline` survives only as the inset frame of secondary buttons.

## Shape & size

- Chamfers: chip 4 · control 8 · card 12 · panel 16 (`rounded-sm` / `rounded-md` / `rounded-xl` / `rounded-panel`).
- Base stroke 1.5px (`--stroke`), base grid 8px, permitted angles 30° / 45° / 60°.
- Controls are 44px tall by default (`sm` 36, `lg` 48); icon buttons 44 × 44 with an `aria-label`.

## Components

> The per-component notes below predate the LabMate pass in places (radii, heights, colours). Where they disagree with the sections above or with `AGENTS.md`, those win.

### Base Atoms

- **Avatars**: `MateAvatar` — a human is a Paper octagon with an Ink outline and one Ink corner facet at the bottom-right; an agent is an Ink hexagon whose top-left plane is Pulse (LabMate §5). Never a circle; generic `Avatar` (`rounded-full`) renders as an octagon.
- **Badges**: 4px radius (`rounded-sm`). Default uses `secondary/secondary-foreground` with `border-border`. Secondary uses `accent/foreground`. Destructive, success, and warning map to global status tokens. Outline uses `background/border/foreground`. Supports `size="sm"` (`text-[11px] px-2`) alongside default.
- **BadgeCount**: Numeric counter, `h-[18px] min-w-[18px] px-1`, `text-[11px]` mono; chamfered like a chip (4px), never a circle. Values above 99 display as "99+".
- **Buttons**:
  - Default / Primary: 8px radius, charcoal fill (`--btn-primary`) with hover/press ramps on the pseudo-element shell. This is the standard high-emphasis action; `default` and `primary` are visual aliases.
  - Outline / Secondary: 8px radius, transparent rest state with a 1px inset ring, gray hover fill, and shell-only press scale. `outline` and `secondary` are visual aliases.
  - Ghost: No chrome at rest; soft gray hover fill. Use for toolbar/icon actions that should not carry standalone affordance.
  - Destructive: Text/icon turns destructive on hover with a light destructive hover fill; avoid solid red buttons for normal destructive actions.
  - Link: Muted text by default, foreground on hover, with underline feedback. Avoid brand purple for ordinary text links.
  - Grouped (`ButtonGroup`): Unified outer border (`border-border`, 8px radius). Internal items divided by `border-r` or `border-b`, no individual borders or radiuses.
  - Brand: Use `variant="brand"` only for rare brand-colored actions (for example the chat Send button), following brand scarcity.
- **In-capsule icon affordance** (the X on a tag/chip, a clear button inside a pill): a small icon button (`size-4`, `size-3` lucide glyph) that **follows the shape of its host container**. This is a deliberate split from the standalone ghost icon Button:
  - Inside a **rounded-rectangle** surface (toolbar, input row, card) the hover chip is a **rounded rectangle** (matches the host's `rounded-md`).
  - Inside a chip, the hover chip echoes the chip's chamfer (4px) — there are no pills or circles in this language.
  - **Colour is never hand-rolled.** The hover fill deepens along the *same ramp the host capsule is built from*: a gray chip (`--accent-gray-soft-active`) deepens to that ramp's next stop (`--accent-gray-border`). Do not borrow the standalone ghost `--btn-ghost-hover` here — it is tuned for a white page and disappears on an already-tinted chip. Icon is `muted-foreground` at rest, `foreground` on hover/focus.
- **Inputs**: Flat. Ink frame at rest (1.5px), pure `background` fill, 8px chamfer. Text sizes via the `size` prop. Focus: a 2px Ink outline with a 2px gap (visible on Paper and on Pulse), the same for every focusable control; errors turn the edge Spark.
- **Checkboxes/Radios**: Flat, soft background (`bg-background`). 1px `border`. The checked state marker (tick/dot) is `foreground` (charcoal), avoiding brand colors.
- **Separators**: Uniformly use the 1px `border` color. Do not use padding/margins that detach them from the container edges (e.g., use full width `border-b` in menus instead of `<Separator mx-1>`).
- **Skeleton**: Flat `bg-muted` block, `rounded-lg`. The loading shimmer is a **single synchronized seam** across a whole cluster (avatar + lines read as one loading surface, never independent per-block pulses) — the "one paper, many windows" model. Implementation lives entirely in `style.css` on `[data-slot="skeleton"]`: a two-close-gray gradient (`--muted` → `--skeleton-mid` → `--muted`) on a **viewport-anchored** sheet (`background-attachment: fixed`), tiled at `--skeleton-tile` (640px) and repeated, animated by exactly one tile width so it loops seamlessly. Because every block samples the *same* viewport-anchored sheet by its own position, the seam stays in sync without any wrapper component. Tile narrower than a typical row → a fresh seam revisits each cluster every cycle (short gap, not a viewport-wide wait). Tune speed via the `2s` duration, gap via `--skeleton-tile`. Reduced-motion freezes to flat `--muted`. **Two deliberate trade-offs of the `fixed` technique**: (1) iOS Safari ignores `background-attachment: fixed` and degrades to element-anchored — the shimmer still animates but loses cross-block sync there; (2) a `transform`/`filter`/`will-change` ancestor re-anchors the `fixed` sheet to that box instead of the viewport (sync holds within the subtree, but tile size/gap is then relative to that box). Both are acceptable for a Chromium desktop-first product; **do not "fix" this into a per-element gradient** — that reintroduces the independent-pulse look this avoids.

### Containers & Layouts

- **Cards**: Paper with a Fog border, 12px chamfer, no shadow (§7.6). Selected: 2px Ink border and a Pulse corner triangle at the top-left.
- **Alerts**: Banners (§7.8). `confirm` is a Pulse banner with a 1.5px Ink border; `destructive` is a Spark banner with Ink text. Accents are fills, never text on Paper.
- **Collapsible**: Flat sub-panels. `bg-background` inside a `border-border` container, items divided by `border-b` (no bottom border on last child). Uses `font-mono` for code-related items.
- **Dropdowns / Popovers / Comboboxes**:
  - `bg-background` with a 1.5px Ink border, no shadow.
  - 8px outer radius.
  - Items use 4px inner radius and `text-sm font-normal text-foreground`.
  - Hover states use `bg-accent` and `text-foreground` (no brand color tints).
  - Group separators must be full-bleed `border-b`.
- **Breadcrumb**: Minimalist. 14px icons, 4px-6px gaps. Active page is `text-foreground font-normal`, inactive is `text-muted-foreground`.
- **Sidebar**:
  - Container uses `primary-foreground` background.
  - Active items use a `sidebar-accent` background and `font-medium` weight (no colored indicator bar or ring).

### Items

- Global: `rounded-lg` (8px), `p-4`, `shadow-none`, `gap-4`.
- Variants:
  - Default: `bg-background`, no border.
  - Outline: `bg-background` + `border border-border`.
  - Muted: `bg-accent`, no border.

### Pagination

- Default page buttons: `bg-background border border-border text-foreground`, `rounded-lg`, `size-9`.
- Active/current page: `bg-foreground text-background border-foreground` (black bg, white text — no brand purple).
- Hover: `hover:bg-accent`.
- Disabled: `opacity-50 text-muted-foreground`.
- Previous/Next: ghost style, transparent bg, hover `bg-accent`.

### Complex / Domain Specific

- **Sonner (Toast Notifications)**: Paper with a 1.5px Ink frame, no shadow, panel chamfer. Success is a Pulse banner, error a Spark banner, both with Ink text and icon. States: default, loading, success, info, warning, error.
- **Table**: Wrapped in a container with `border border-border rounded-sm` (6px). Header row height 41px with `py-[10px]`, data rows 38px with `py-[8.5px]`. Footer uses `bg-muted/50`. Empty state centers an icon + `text-muted-foreground` message in `h-[204px]`. Caption is centered `text-sm text-muted-foreground`.
- **TagsInput**: Flat design. `rounded-lg` (no shadow). Focus state uses `ring-ring/20 ring-2` (not `ring-[3px]`).
- **Chat Input (Main Area)**:
  - Flat container (`shadow-none`), `border-border`, 10px radius.
  - Divided horizontally by top/bottom 1px borders (`border-t`, `border-b`).
  - Send button uniquely retains `bg-primary` for high conversion focus.
  - Model selector (Badge style) floats inside the top border area, using `bg-accent` or `bg-background` depending on state.
- **OTP Input (PinInput)**: Flat group built on reka-ui `PinInput`. Each cell is `size-9 bg-background text-sm shadow-none`. The first cell gets `border border-border rounded-l-lg`, middle cells use `border-y border-r border-border` (no left border to avoid doubling), and the last cell adds `rounded-r-lg`. Focus state applies `border-2 border-ring` (dark ring, not primary purple). Supports an optional `PinInputSeparator` between groups.

## AI Image Generation & Component Reuse Rules

To ensure visual consistency when generating images or extrapolating designs via AI based on this system, strictly adhere to the following composition rules:

1. **The "Flat Atom" Law:** If it's a basic interactive element (button, badge, input, toggle, checkbox), it **cannot** have a shadow. It must rely on tokenized borders and background contrast (`--background` vs `--accent` vs `--foreground`).
2. **The "Menu Underline" Law:** Whenever rendering a list of items inside a container (Dropdowns, Comboboxes, Sidebar Sub-menus, Collapsibles), items must be divided by a full-width, 1px horizontal line (`border-b`), terminating cleanly on the last item. Do not leave floating separators with margins.
3. **The "Monochrome Hover" Law:** Focus and hover states for secondary items must use `bg-accent` and `text-foreground`. Never apply the brand purple (`#8b56e3`) as a background highlight for menus.
4. **No elevation:** There are no shadows at any level (LabMate §2.3). A standalone focal piece (login, central card) is set apart by a 1.5px Ink border and space, never by a shadow.
5. **The "Brand Scarcity" Law:** The scheme brand color (`--brand` / `--primary`) is the most expensive pixel on the screen. It can only be used for:
   - The absolute primary completion action on a screen (e.g., the Chat "Send" button).
   - Micro-indicators of "current active state" (e.g., a 2px vertical bar next to an active sidebar menu item, or a 5px status dot).

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `bg-secondary` with `border-border` for standard filled controls; reserve `bg-primary` / `bg-brand` for explicit brand actions and high-emphasis CTAs.
- **Don't** use `shadow-sm` on buttons, inputs, or alerts. Keep atomic components strictly flat.
- **Don't** use shadows anywhere — not even on focal cards; a 1.5px Ink border carries the separation.
- **Don't** use colored backgrounds for Alert or Badge variants (like `bg-red-50`). Keep them white and use text/icon color to convey meaning (or solid red for destructive badges).
- **Do** maintain the 1px `#e5e5e5` (`--border`) across all structural dividing lines, ensuring they connect edge-to-edge (no floating separators).
- **Don't** use primary colors for hover or active states in standard dropdowns and menus; stick to `bg-accent` and `text-foreground`.
